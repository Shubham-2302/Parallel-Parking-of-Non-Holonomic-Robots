# Parallel-Parking-of-Non-Holonomic-Robots

A common path planning problem for autonomous vehicles involves maneuvering in tight spaces and cluttered environments, particularly while parking. This project aims to utlise a differential kinematics robot and a truck and trailer configuration and plan and execute the parallel parking manuver The differential drive robot uses hybrid Astart planner to plan the path and a hot pursuit controller to control the robot. The truck and trailer configuration uses Kinodynamic motion planning algorithm.

This Github Repository contains implementation of Motion Planner that are used to parallel park a 1) Differential Drive robot ( a delivery robot) and 2) A truck with a trailer attached.
